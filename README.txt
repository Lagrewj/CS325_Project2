Project 2: Coin Change (as of Friday night the 17th)
Group 3
CS325 Summer 2015

Created by: Yunsik Choi, Jonathan Lagrew, Tri-Solomon Huynh

1. Compile the program with the make file. 
2. Run the program with the ./change command followed by two input files.

-The first input file will be used for the greedy and dynamic programming algorithms.
-The second input file is used with the bruteForce algorithm.

The program assumes that the coin arrays in the input file is sorted.

Example command line input: ./change prob6.txt prob6brute.txt

Output file name for the first input file will be [first input file name]change.txt
Output file name for the second input file will be [second input file name]change.txt

The input and output file names will be printed to the screen along with the total
running times of each algorithm for calculating the number of coins and specific coins
used for all arrays in the file.

INPUT FILE NAMES (so far): 
(brute force)
  - prob6brute.txt
  
(greedy and dynamic programming)
  - prob6.txt
